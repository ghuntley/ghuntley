This repository is the [monorepo][] for my personal software.

Everything in here is built using [Nix][] with an automatic attribute-set layout
that mirrors the filesystem layout of the repository (this might feel familiar
to users of Bazel).

If you've ended up here and have no idea who I am, feel free to follow me [on
Twitter][].
